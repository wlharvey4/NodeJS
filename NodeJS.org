#+cindex:V8 engine
“Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
engine.”

“Learn how to write fast, highly scalable network applications on a
JavaScript-based platform.”

{{{heading(Event-Driven Asynchronous I/O Model Designed for Scalable
Network Applications)}}}

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is
designed to build scalable network applications.  Users of Node.js are
free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no
locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the
process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are
very reasonable to develop in Node.js.

#+cindex:event model
#+cindex:event loop
Node.js takes the event model a bit further.  It presents an event
loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library.  In other
systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.  In
Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call.  Node.js simply
enters the event loop after executing the input script.  Node.js exits
the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform.

HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and
low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation
of a web library or framework.

* The Node Environment
Node is primarily used in server applications, but Node can be
installed on almost any machine and used for any purpose.

** Install Node.js
- [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][Downloads page]]

** Say Hello in Node
Take a look at the “Hello, World” application included in the Node
documentation.  To re-create the application, create a text document
with the following JavaScript and save it as ~hello.js~.

#+caption:Node’s Hello World
#+name:node-hello-world
#+header: :mkdirp yes
#+begin_src js -n :tangle src/hello.js
  var http = require('http');
  http.createServer(function (request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.end('Hello World\n');
  }).listen(8124);

  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');
#+end_src

To run the application, open a terminal and change to the directory
where your saved file is located and type ~node hello.js~ to run the
application.  The result is printed out to the command line, via the
~console.log()~ function call in the application.

- start server process: [[shell:node src/hello.js&]]
- open web browser:     [[http://localhost:8124]]
- kill server process:  [[shell:pkill node]]


Here, JavaScript creates a web server that displays a web page with
the words “Hello World” when accessed via a browser.  It demonstrates
several key components of a Node application.

First, it includes the module necessary to run a simple HTTP server:
the appropriately named =HTTP= module.

: var http = require('http');

External functionality for Node is incorporated via modules that
export specific types of functionality that can then be used in an
application (or another module).  They’re very similar to the
libraries you’ve used in other languages.

The module is imported using the Node ~require~ statement, and the
result assigned to a local variable.  Once imported, the local
variable can be used to instantiate the web server, via the
~http.createServer()~ function.  In the function parameters, we see
one of the fundamental constructs of Node: the callback ([[Example 1-1]]).
It’s the anonymous function that’s passing the web request and
response into the code to process the web request and provide a
response.

#+caption:Example of a callback function
#+name:Example 1-1
#+begin_src js -n
  http.createServer(function (request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.end('Hello World\n');
  }).listen(8124);
#+end_src

#+cindex:event loop
#+cindex:single-thread
#+cindex:asynchronous environment
#+cindex:callback function
JavaScript is single-threaded, and the way Node emulates an
asynchronous environment in a single-threaded environment is via an
event loop, with associated callback functions that are called once a
specific event has been triggered.  In [[Example 1-1]], when a web request
is received, the callback function is called.

The ~console.log()~ message is output to the terminal as soon as the
call to create the server is made.  The program doesn’t stop and
block, waiting for a web request to be made.

: console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');

Once the server is created and has received a request, the callback
function writes a plain text header with server status of 200 back to
the browser, writes out the Hello World message, and then ends the
response.

*** Hello World Tweaked
The tweaked code is in [[Example 1-2]].  In it, the application code is
modified to parse the incoming request to look for a query string.
The name in the string is extracted and used to determine the type of
content returned.  Almost any name will return a personalized
response, but if you use ~name=burningbird~ as the query, you’ll get
an image.  If no query string is used, or no name passed, the name
variable is set to =world=.

#+caption:Example 1-2
#+name:Example 1-2
#+begin_src js -n :tangle src/hello-tweaked.js
  var http = require('http');
  var fs = require('fs');

  http.createServer(function (req, res) {
     var name = require('url').parse(req.url, true).query.name;

     if (name === undefined) name = 'world';

     if (name == 'burningbird') {
        var file = './resources/phoenix5a.png';
        fs.stat(file, function (err, stat) {
           if (err) {
              console.error(err);
              res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
              res.end("Sorry, Burningbird isn't around right now \n");
           } else {
              var img = fs.readFileSync(file);
              res.contentType = 'image/png';
              res.contentLength = stat.size;
              res.end(img, 'binary');
           }
        });
     } else {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
        res.end('Hello ' + name + '\n');
     }
  }).listen(8124);

  console.log('Server running at port 8124/');
#+end_src

- Start tweaked hello server     [[shell:node src/hello-tweaked.js&]]
- Open tweaked hello in browser: [[http:localhost:8124/?name=burningbird]]
- Kill tweaked hello server      [[shell:pkill -f node]]


Not much extra code, but there are several differences between the
basic Hello World application and the tweaked version.  From the top,
a new module is included in the application, named ~fs~.  This is the
File System module.

There’s also another module imported, but not in the same way as the
other two:

: var name = require('url').parse(req.url, true).query.name;

Exported module properties can be chained, so we can both import the
module and use its functions in the same line.  This frequently
happens with the URL module, whose only purpose is to provide a URL
utility.

** Node Hosting Environments
When you’re ready to start providing greater access to your
applications, you’ll either need to find an environment where you can
run a Node application, such as:
- a virtual private network (VPN) or
- a host that specifically provides for Node application support

*** Hosting Node on a Server---VPS---Managed Host
#+cindex:VPS
#+cindex:host Node application
Hosting Node on a virtual private server (VPS) is a simple matter.

- https://www.linode.com


You do have root access for your VPS and can pretty much do whatever
you want.  The issue, though, with a VPS is the same issue you’d have
if you hosted your own server: you have to maintain the server.  This
includes setting up an email system and an alternative web server,
most likely Apache or Nginx, to handle firewalls and other security,
email, etc.  It’s not trivial.

If you’re comfortable with managing all aspects of a Internet-faced
environment, a VPS can be an affordable option for hosting a Node
application.  At least until you’re ready to push it into production,
in which case you may want to look at hosting the application in the
cloud.

*** Cloud Hosting
#+cindex:cloud
Node applications are well-suited to cloud-based implementations.
When you host a Node application in the cloud, what you’re really
doing, typically, is creating the application on your own server or
PC, testing it, making sure it’s what you want, and then pushing the
application out to the cloud server.  A cloud server for Node allows
you to create the Node application you want to create, using the
resources of whatever database system or other system you wish, but
without having to manage the server directly.  You can focus
specifically on the Node application without having to worry about FTP
or email servers, or general server maintenance.

** Node LTS and Upgrading
One result of the merge is a strict timeline of Node releases, based
on semantic versioning (Semver).  Semver releases features as three
groups of numbers, each with a specific meaning.  I.e., Version 4.3.2:
- The major release is 4 :: This number will only increase when a
     major, backward- incompatible change is made to Node.
- The minor release is 3 :: This number increases when new
     functionality is added, but the functionality is still backward
     compatible.
- The patch release is 2 :: This number changes when security or other
     bug fixes require a new release of the application. It is also
     backward compatible.

** Node V8 ES6
Behind Node is a JavaScript engine.  For most implementations, the
engine is V8.  Originally created by Google for Chrome, the V8 source
code was open-sourced in 2008.  The V8 JavaScript engine was created
to improve the speed of JavaScript by incorporating a just-in-time
(JIT) compiler that compiles JavaScript to machine code rather than
interpreting it, which had been the norm for JavaScript for years.
The V8 engine is written in C++.

*** ES 2015
When Node v4.0 released, it did so with support for V8 4.5, the same
version of the engine being used by Chrome.  The Node maintainers are
also committed to supporting upcoming versions of V8 as they’re
released.  This means that Node now incorporates support for many of
the new ECMA-262 (ECMAScript 2015 or ES6) features.  Node v6 supports
V8 version 5.0, and new releases of Node will support newer versions
of V8 accordingly.

*** Harmony
In prior versions of Node, to access the new ES6 features, you would
have to use the harmony flag ({{{option(--harmony)}}}) when running the
application:

: node --harmony app.js

Now, ES6 feature support is based on the following criteria (directly
from the Node.js documentation):

- shipping features :: are turned on by default on Node.js and do not
     require any kind of runtime flag.

- staged features :: require a runtime flag:
     {{{option(--es_staging)}}} (or its synonym,
     {{{option(--harmony)}}).

- in-progress features :: can be activated individually by their
     respective harmony flag (e.g.,
     {{{option(--harmony_destructuring)}}}).


the following are some of the ES6 features supported in Node:

- classes
- promises
- symbols
- arrow functions
- generators
- collections
- let
- spread operator

** Node C/C++
Though the language used to create Node applications is based in
JavaScript, much of Node is actually written in C++.  You can choose
to extend Node functionality using C/C++ to create an add-on.  Writing
a Node add-on is not the same as writing a more traditional C/C++
application.  For one, there are libraries, such as the V8 library,
that you’ll typically access.  For another, the Node add-on is not
compiled using the tools you would normally use.  Once you’ve written
the code, you’ll need to use a tool, ~node-gyp~, to actually compile
the add-on into a ~.node~ file.

* Node Building Blocks
The environments between browser-based applications and Node.js
applications are very different.

One fundamental difference between Node and its browser-based
JavaScript cousin is the buffer for binary data.  Most binary data
functionality in Node is implemented with the =Buffer= class.  The
=buffer= is one of Node’s global objects.

Two fundamental objects in Node are:
- global
- process


The global object in Node is fundamentally different than the global
object we’re used to in the browser.

Node developers also have access to another global object, =process=,
which provides a bridge between the Node application and its
environment.  The =process= object is pure Node.

One aspect of Node should be familiar to frontend developers, and
that’s its event-driven asynchronous nature.  The difference in Node
is that we’re waiting for files to open rather than for users to click
a button.

Other global components include:

- require
- exports
- module
- console

** Global Objects
In the browser, when you declare a variable at the top level, it’s
declared globally.  It doesn’t work that way in Node.  When you
declare a variable in a module or application in Node, the variable
isn’t globally available; it’s restricted to the module or
application.

Eliminating a shared namespace is a distinct improvement, but it isn’t
universal.  What =global= does share in all environments is access to
all the globally available Node objects and functions, including the
=process= object.

*** Process
The process object is an essential component of the Node environment,
as it provides information about the runtime environment.  In
addition, standard input/ output (I/O) occurs through process, you can
gracefully terminate a Node application, and you can even signal when
the Node event loop has finished a cycle.

The process object provides access to information about the Node
environment, as well as the runtime environment.  To explore, we’ll
use the =-p= command-line option with node, which executes a script
and returns an immediate result.  For instance, to check out the
process.versions property, type the following:

: $ node -p "process.versions"

#+begin_example
{ http_parser: '2.5.0',
      node: '4.2.1',
      v8: '4.5.103.35',
      uv: '1.7.5',
      zlib: '1.2.8',
      ares: '1.10.1-DEV',
      icu: '56.1',
      modules: '46',
      openssl: '1.0.2d' }
#+end_example

Versions for various Node components and dependencies are listed,
including the version of V8, OpenSSL (the library used for secure
communications), Node itself, and so on.

The =process.env= property provides a great deal of information about
what Node sees in your development/production environment:

: $ node -p "process.env"

To explore the process.release values, use the following:

: $ node -p "process.release"

#+begin_example
{
  name: 'node',
  lts: 'Erbium',
  sourceUrl: 'https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.13.0/node-v12.13.0.tar.gz',
  headersUrl: 'https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.13.0/node-v12.13.0-headers.tar.gz'
}
#+end_example

What should be consistent between Node releases are several objects
and function.s essential for many applications.  Among them is access
to the standard I/O, and the ability to gracefully end a Node
application.

Standard streams are pre-established communication channels between an
application and the environment.  They consist of:

- a standard input (stdin),
- standard output (stdout), and
- standard error (stderr)


In a Node application, these channels provide communication between
the Node application and the terminal.  They’re a way for you to
communicate directly with the application.

Node supports the channels with three process functions:

- process.stdin: a readable stream for stdin
- process.stdout: a writable stream for stdout
- process.stderr: a writable stream for stderr


The process I/O functions inherit from =EventEmitter=, which means
they can emit events, and you can capture these events and process any
data.  To process incoming data using =process.stdin=, you first of
all need to set the encoding for the stream.  If you don’t, you’ll get
the results as a buffer rather than a string:

: process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');

Next we’ll listen for the =readable= event, which lets us know there’s
a chunk of data, ready to be read.  We’ll then use the
~process.stdin.read()~ function to read this data in, and if the data
isn’t =null=, echo it back out to ~process.stdout~, using the
~process.stdout.write()~ function:

#+begin_src js -n
  process.stdin.on('readable', function() {
      var input = process.stdin.read();
      if (input !== null) {
          // echo the text
          process.stdout.write(input);
      }
  });
#+end_src

Now, we could forgo setting the encoding, and get the same
results---we’ll read a buffer in and write a buffer out---but to the
user of the application, it looks like we’re working with text
(strings).  We’re not, though.

You can terminate an application as part of the application using
~process.exit()~.  You can even signal whether the application
terminated successfully or if a failure occurred.  We’ll modify the
simple I/O test application to “listen” for an exit string, and then
exit the program when it occurs.

#+caption:Demonstrating standard I/O in Node, and exiting application
#+name:process-stdin-with-exit
#+header: :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env node"
#+begin_src js -n :tangle src/stdin_with_exit.js
  process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');

  process.stdin.on('readable', function() {
      var input;
      while((input = process.stdin.read()) !== null) {
          // echo the text
          process.stdout.write(input);
          if (input.trim() == 'exit')
              process.exit(0);
     }
  });
#+end_src

** Buffers---Typed Arrays---Strings
In browser-based JavaScript, in the early days, there never was a need
to handle binary data (an octet stream).  Originally, JavaScript was
meant to deal with string values accessed or output to alert windows
or forms.  Even when Ajax changed the game, the data between client
and server was string (Unicode) based.

Things changed, though, when the demands on JavaScript became more
sophisticated.  Not only do we still have Ajax, but we also have
WebSockets.  In addition, what we can do in the browser has
expanded---rather than simple form access, we have new technologies
such as WebGL and Canvas.

The solution in JavaScript and in the browser is the =ArrayBuffer=,
manipulated through typed arrays.  In Node, the solution is the
=Buffer=.

Originally, the two were not the same.  However, when ~io.js~ and
~Node.js~ merged in Node v4.0.0, Node also received support for typed
arrays via V8 v4.5.  The Node buffer is now backed by =Uint8Array=,
one of the typed arrays representing an array of 8-bit unsigned
integers.

In Node, the =Buffer= class is the primary data structure used with
most I/O, and you can’t swap in a typed array without your application
failing.  In addition, converting a Node buffer to a typed array may
be doable, but it’s not without issues.

So you can use both types of octet stream handling in Node, but for
the most part, you’re primarily using buffer.

*** Buffers---JSON---StringDecoder---UTF8 Strings
A Node buffer is raw binary data that’s been allocated outside the V8
heap. It’s managed via a class, the =Buffer=.  Once allocated, the
buffer can’t be resized.  The buffer is the default data type for file
access: unless a specific encoding is provided when reading and
writing to a file, the data is read into, or out of, a buffer.

**** Creating a Node Buffer
In Node v4, you can create a new buffer directly using the new
keyword:
: let buf = new Buffer(24);
Creating a new Node buffer doesn’t initialize the contents.  You’ll
want to fill the buffer as soon as you create it:
: buf.fill(0); // fills buffer with zeros

Beginning with Node v5.7.0, you can also specify an encoding for
~buf.fill()~, using the syntax: 
: buf.fill(string[, start[, end]] [, encoding]).

You can also directly create a new buffer by passing the constructor
function an array of octets, another buffer, or a string.  The buffer
is created with the copied contents of all three.

{{{heading(Node v6 Buffer Creation)}}}

In Node v6, however, the constructors have been deprecated in favor of
new Buffer methods to create new buffers: 
- ~Buffer.from()~,
- ~Buffer.alloc()~, and
- ~Buffer.allocUnsafe()~.

***** Buffer.from() Method
With the ~Buffer.from()~ function, passing in an array returns a
buffer with a copy of the contents.  However, if you pass in an
=ArrayBuffer=, with optional byte offset and length, the buffer shares
the same memory as the =ArrayBuffer=.  Passing in a buffer copies the
contents of the buffer, and passing in a string copies the string.

***** Buffer.alloc() Method
The ~Buffer.alloc()~ function creates a filled buffer of a certain
size.

***** Buffer.allocUnsafe() Method
The ~Buffer.allocUnsafe()~ method creates a buffer of a certain size,
but may contain old or sensitive data, and will then need to be
filled, with ~buf.fill()~ to ensure otherwise.

**** JSON and Buffers
Buffers can convert to JSON, as well as strings.

#+begin_src js -n
"use strict";
let buf = Buffer.from('This is my pretty example');
    let json = JSON.stringify(buf);
    console.log(json);
#+end_src

This results in the output:

#+begin_example
{
    "type":"Buffer",
    "data":[84,104,105,115,32,105,115,32,109,121,32,112,114,101,116,
            116,121,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101]
}
#+end_example

The JSON specifies that the type of object being transformed is a
=Buffer=, and its data follows.  Of course, what we’re seeing is the
data after it’s been stored in a buffer as a sequence of octets, which
aren’t human-readable.

To go full circle, we can parse the buffer data back out of the JSON
object, and then use the ~Buffer.toString()~ method to convert to a
string.

#+begin_src js -n
"use strict";
let buf = Buffer.from('This is my pretty example');
let json = JSON.stringify(buf);
let buf2 = Buffer.from(JSON.parse(json).data); 

console.log(buf2.toString()); // this is my pretty example
#+end_src

**** StringDecoder and Buffers
Using ~Buffer.toString()~ isn’t the only way we can convert a buffer
to a string.  We can also use a helper class, =StringDecoder=.  This
object’s sole purpose is to decode buffer values to UTF-8 strings, but
it does so with a little more flexibility and recoverability.

If the ~buffer.toString()~ method gets an incomplete UTF-8 character
sequence, it returns gibberish.  The =StringDecoder=, on the other
hand, buffers the incomplete sequence until it’s complete and then
returns the result.  If you’re receiving a UTF-8 result as chunks in a
stream, you should use =StringDecoder=.

You can also convert a string to an existing buffer using
~buffer.write()~.  It’s important, though, that the buffer be
correctly sized to hold the number of octets necessary for the
characters.

*** Buffer Manipulation

{{{heading(Reading and Writing Buffer Contents)}}}

You can read and write buffer contents at a given offset with a
variety of typed functions.  You can also read each individual 8-bit
integer, using ~buffer.readUInt8()~.

Node supports reading in and writing out signed and unsigned 8-, 16-,
and 32-bit integers, as well as floats and doubles. For all types
other than the 8-bit integers, you can also pick whether you want
little-endian or big-endian format.  You can also write 8-bit integers
directly using an array-like format: ~buf[0] = 0x63~.

{{{heading(Create Slices of Buffers using ~slice()~)}}}

In addition to reading and writing to a specific buffer offset, you
can also create a new buffer consisting of a section of the old, using
~buffer.slice()~.  Modifying the contents of the new buffer also
modifies the contents of the old buffer.

{{{heading(Testing Buffer Equality with ~equals()~)}}}

If you ever need to test whether buffers are equivalent, you can use
the ~buffer.equals()~ function:
: if (buf1.equals(buf2)) console.log('buffers are equal');

{{{heading(Copying Buffer Contents with ~copy()~)}}}

You can also copy the bytes from one buffer to another using
~buffer.copy()~.  You can copy all or part of the bytes using optional
parameters.

{{{heading(Comparing Buffers using ~compare()~)}}}

If you need to compare buffers, you can use ~buffer.compare()~, which
returns a value indicating whether the compared buffer lexically comes
before or after.  If the compared buffer comes before, a value of -1
is returned; after, a value of 1.  If the two buffers have equivalent
bytes, a value of 0 is returned:

** Inspector
#+cindex:debugging client
#+cindex:@option{--inspect} option
- {{{option(--inspect)}}} :: When started with the
     {{{option(--inspect)}}} switch, a Node.js process listens for a
     debugging client.  By default, it will listen at host and port
     =127.0.0.1:9229=.  Each process is also assigned a unique UUID.

     #+cindex:Inspector client
     #+cindex:UUID
- Inspector client :: Inspector clients must know and specify host
     address, port, and UUID[fn:1] to connect. A full URL will look
     something like:

     #+cindex:@code{SIGUSR1} client
- =SIGUSR1= signal :: Node.js will also start listening for debugging
     messages if it receives a =SIGUSR1= signal.  In Node.js 8 and
     later, it will activate the Inspector API.

{{{heading(New Features List)}}}

- Stable HTTP/2 in Node 10.

  With Node v10 the ~http2~ module has become a stable addition to the
  Node core.  You can use it on its own:
  - [[https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-http-2-push/][HTTP/2 Server Push with Node.js]]

- ECMAScript Modules---ESM

  The problem is that the two module systems are not compatible so the
  Modules Team had to find a proper solution so JavaScript modules
  could be built in a platform agnostic way and could be used both in
  Node and in browsers.  Node.js v10 does not bring the full
  implementation of ESMs, but we will definitely see rapid iterations
  regarding the topic.

  See also [[https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_modules.html][Modules]]

- Error Codes

  In Node.js v10 all errors thrown by the Node.js APIs have an error
  code as well, meaning you don’t need to match the error message that
  should be readable for humans to begin with.

- Experimental fs Promises

  Node.js v8 introduced ~util.promisify~ to easily wrap functions that
  provide a callback API.  In the latest release functions of the ~fs~
  return promises directly, eliminating the extra step and overhead of
  the old way.

- N-API

  The N-API provides an abstraction layer over the V8 / NAN APIs so
  changes in those can be handled in a higher level layer, resulting
  in a more stable surface that native addon developers can use.  So
  far it was an experimental feature, but it has been promoted to
  stable in Node v10.

- V8 6.6

  Node.js is shipped with the V8 v6.6 that brings async generators and
  array performance improvements.  ~Array.reduce~ has become 10 times
  faster for holey double arrays.  The performance of async generators
  and async iteration has also been increased by a great margin.

  The new release provides new JavaScript language features as
  well. The full list can be found [[https://v8.dev][here]].

** Node.js v12
*** New Features You Shouldn’t Miss
- https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-12-new-features/

- V8 updated to version 7.4

  - Async stack traces arrived

  - Faster async/await implementation

  - New JavaScript language features

  - Performance tweaks & improvements

  - Progress on Worker threads, N-API

- Default HTTP parser switched to llhttp

- New experimental “Diagnostic Reports” feature


{{{heading(assert module adjustments in Node 12)}}}

Starting from v12.0.0 the assertion methods validate the required
arguments.  Instead of returning a misleading =ERR_ASSERTION= error,
the methods indicate if there are arguments missing with the
=ERR_MISSING_ARGS= error code.

{{{heading(TLS 1.3 is now default in Node.js 12)}}}

[[https://www.ssl.com/blogs/need-know-tls-1-3/][TLS 1.3]] is now the default max protocol supported by Node.js.

After 8 years, TLS has been updated and it offers enhanced security
and performance.  Support for RSA has been removed because of its
history of bugs and it also did not support forward secrecy.  The
protocol also got safer cipher options and modes while halved the
number of handshake roundtrips contrary to its 1.2 predecessor which
required two roundtrips.

{{{heading(JavaScript Language Features)}}}

{{{subheading(Async Stack Traces)}}}

So far, developers faced the problem of V8 truncating the stack trace
up to the most recent await.  Thanks to a recent update to the engine,
Node.js now tracks the asynchronous call frames in the ~error.stack~
property.

#+begin_src js -n
async function wait_1(x) {
 await wait_2(x)
}

async function wait_2(x) {
 await wait_3(x);
}

async function wait_3(x) {
 await x;

 throw new Error("Oh boi")
}

wait_1(1).catch(e => console.log(e.stack));
#+end_src

This code example prints the following outputs before and after async
stack traces got into Node.js.

#+caption:Under Node.js v12.0.0
#+name:under-node.js-v12.0.0
[[file:resources/04-async-error-Nodejs-v12.png]]

{{{subheading(Public Class Fields)}}}

Instead of listing all variables with default values in the
constructor, you can define them on the class level.

#+caption:Public Class Fields under v10
#+name:public-class-fields-under-v10
#+begin_src js -n
class Vehicle {
 constructor(type) {
   this.type = type;
   this.speed = 80;
 }
}
#+end_src

Thus, you can omit the constructor if no parameter is needed or just
focus on the required variables on initialization.

#+caption:Public Class Fields under v12
#+name:public-class-fields-under-v12
#+begin_src js -n
class Vehicle2 {
 speed = 80;

 constructor(type) {
   this.type = type;
 }
}
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Private Class Fields)}}}

JavaScript brought in the concept of private class fields which
finally landed in Node.js v12.  To mark fields private just give them
a name starting with =#=.  If You try to access a private field
outside of the class it throws a =SyntaxError= error.

#+caption:Private Class Fields in v12
#+name:private-class-fields-in-v12
#+begin_src js -n
class Counter {
 #count = 0

 increment() {
   this.#count++;
 }

 get value() {
   return this.#count;
 }
}

const counter = new Counter()
counter.increment()
counter.value // 1

counter.#value // SyntaxError
#+end_src

{{{heading(llhttp parser in Node.js 12)}}}

llhttp is a port of http_parser that improves on maintainability and
benchmark results. The library claims to be faster by 116%.

{{{heading(Diagnostic Reports)}}}

- [[https://github.com/nodejs/node-report][node-report]]

This utility tool is known as ~node-report~ that was recently brought
into the Node.js core.  It helps to detect abnormal terminations,
memory leaks, high CPU usage, unexpected errors and more.

Run the ~node --experimental-report --report-on-fatalerror index.js~
to get a JSON summary on native stack traces, heap statistics,
resource usage, etc.

Node.js got a bunch of diagnostic utilities in the recent versions to
aid the investigation on errors and bottlenecks that are difficult to
pinpoint. If you want to create runtime statistics of the heap usage
you can do that by calling v8.getHeapSnapshot() that was added in
v11.13.0.

{{{heading(Worker threads in Node 12)}}}

The ~worker_threads~ module got into Node.js in v10.5.0.  It’s still
in experimental but a lot of effort has gone into its progress.
Node.js was designed single-threaded which fits I/O heavy use cases
well.  CPU heavy operations, however, increase execution time and lead
to slow performance.

Now, [[https://12factor.net][12factor]] says that these long-running operations should be
offloaded to individual processes. However, this might not be a valid
solution, when you need to expose the result of CPU heavy computations
such as data-mining and crypto over HTTP. Workers open the possibility
to utilize more threads at once to execute these actions parallel.

It’s not a stable solution though but it might be game-changing for
the Node.js community. Workers offer Node.js an opportunity to become
a player on the field of data science beside R, Scala, Python and
more.
